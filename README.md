# Notepad using Two-Dimensional Doubly Linked List

This project implements a console-based Notepad using a two-dimensional doubly linked list. The Notepad allows users to write and manipulate text similar to a real Notepad application, including cursor movement, text insertion, deletion, saving to a file, loading from a file, and quitting.

## Features

- **Cursor Control**: Use arrow keys to move the cursor within the text.
- **Text Manipulation**: Insert, delete, and modify text at the cursor position.
- **Saving and Loading**: Save the current text to a file (`save.txt`) using `S`, and load text from the same file using `L`.
- **Quit**: Exit the Notepad using `Q`.
- **Doubly Linked List Structure**: Internally manages text storage using a two-dimensional doubly linked list.
- **Destructor**: Properly cleans up memory upon program termination.
